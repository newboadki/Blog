# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      about_this_page: "I am a software engineer and I live in London. Basketball player. Occasional runner. Avid reader. Nomad of the modern times, having worked in Norway, London and Cape Town, SA. Believer in the idea of better software is possible. </br>Currently I work writing software for iOS platforms, but the core of what fascinates me about software engineering is platform independent. I love solving scalability and resusability problems, asbtracting the concrete, simplifying the entangled."

          desc: "I have a master degree in Computer Science from the University of Seville, Spain, where specialised in software development. For my master thesis, I worked on a project to create a colaborative web-based tool for research groups, where members could effectively share information and keep track of what other member and or groups were doing."

          desc: "I work as an iOS engineer for IG Index in London. But I have been developing for Apple platforms for nearly four years. I love every second of it. I have developed for diferent platforms, and what I like the most about this one is the degree of proffesionalism of the tools, APIS and reference materials. This platform leads the way in many respects and has set the bar incredibly high in terms of what the user expects from software and that is remarkable."

          desc: "This is an amazing app, it's really, really good. This is the description, and that's pretty much all I could ever say. Just listened to Brent Simmons interview in BitSplitting podcast which is driven by Daniel Jalkut, a former Apple engineer. He went there right after the university and didn't last for very long to be honest. The interesting part is that he went INDI ever since. He has a family, and somehow he's able to sustain them. Amazing, I would like to see the numbers."
