# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      about_this_page: "I am a software engineer and I live in London. Basketball player. Occasional runner. Avid reader. Nomad of the modern times, having worked in Norway, London and Cape Town, SA. Believer in the idea of better software is possible. </br>Currently I work writing software for iOS platforms, but the core of what fascinates me about software engineering is platform independent. I love solving scalability and resusability problems, asbtracting the concrete, simplifying the entangled."

          desc: "This is an amazing app, it's really, really good. This is the description, and that's pretty much all I could ever say. Just listened to Brent Simmons interview in BitSplitting podcast which is driven by Daniel Jalkut, a former Apple engineer. He went there right after the university and didn't last for very long to be honest. The interesting part is that he went INDI ever since. He has a family, and somehow he's able to sustain them. Amazing, I would like to see the numbers."
